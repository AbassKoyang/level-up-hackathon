This is my project for the Level Up Front hackathon i participated in.

We were tasked with creating a Shopify Dashboard Clone with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The hacckathon wasn't like the usal hackathons, it was conducted with the aim of teaching developers about the importance of accessibility and how to create accessible websites.

The hackathon was an eye-opener for me as didn't use to take accessibility into consideration when building a web app.

I learnt a lot about accessibility while working on this project.
The results for the hackathon is not out yet and i still don't know my faith. LolðŸ˜…
